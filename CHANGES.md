# Changes

## 2026-06-08

- Added `make check` as the shared repository verification alias.
- Guarded capture runtime-error observers against malformed notifications
  instead of force-unwrapping `userInfo` and `NSError` metadata.
- Extended the source checker to require safe runtime-error extraction and
  fallback logging in both app-level and document-level observers.
- Added a Makefile verification gate for shell syntax, Xcode project metadata,
  and capture permission metadata.
- Fixed `build.sh` so it is valid under its `/bin/sh` shebang.
- Added a camera usage description for connected-device mirroring permission
  prompts.
- Documented the local verification workflow.
